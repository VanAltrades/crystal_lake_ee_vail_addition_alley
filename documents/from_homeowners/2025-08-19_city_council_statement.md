Good evening,

I’ve called Crystal Lake home for 20 years. I am fortunate to live on Illinois Street because of its historic legacy and my wonderful neighbors -- whom I speak for tonight.

Recently, I received a letter from the City regarding an “alley” adjacent to my property. I use this alley on a daily basis to walk my dog while my neighbors use it to access trailers and backyard brush - because -- according to my Plat of Survey, and the official record dating back to 1909… 
This “alley” is explicitly documented as a “Public Alley”. 
Yet -- the City’s letter states the alley “is not public right-of-way and the City is not responsible.”

This position conflicts with stamped survey documents from an Illinois Professional Land Surveyor and the lived experience of my neighbors. For this reason, we ask the City to respond to the following 7 questions:

What is a “Public Alleyway” as defined in the Official Record?

Who has held legal ownership of the alleyway from 1909 onward?

Why does the City believe it is not responsible for this property?

Why were barricades installed at each end of the alley, which limit vehicle access to the majority of residents despite historic vehicle use and access to the alley?

When will additional City residents, adjacent to “Public Alleyways”, be sent letters asserting the City is not responsible for “Public Alleyways”?

Why weren’t the residents I represent given an option that reflects our unanimous preference to keep the alley maintained as a public way?

When will the City update its proposed options to include the unanimous wishes of myself and the neighbors I represent?

Because these questions remain unanswered, the City’s letter does not present a fair or accurate basis for decision-making. Instead, it imposes a false dilemma built on an unverified premise.
The City’s request must be considered unreasonable and unenforceable until the City reconciles its position with the official record and provides clarity on ownership, maintenance, and resident rights. Despite the language and actions of the City, the Public Alley continues to serve as a public way, as evidenced by daily use. On behalf of my neighbors, I respectfully ask the City to withdraw or revise its letter to reflect the official record, establish clear procedures around response threshold and majority vote, and include resident-drafted options that reflect the wishes of myself and my neighbors. 

Thank you.
