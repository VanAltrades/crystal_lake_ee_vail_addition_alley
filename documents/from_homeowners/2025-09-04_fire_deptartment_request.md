I am a homeowner on Illinois Street (E.E. Vail Addition). The City has installed barricades and indicated it is not responsible for the platted alley behind our homes. Several homeowners on our block rely on rear access due to steep grade changes from the street, while others require alley access to their garages.

Under City Code Chapter 251 (adopting the 2018 IFC)—including Appendix D and §503.4 (Obstruction of fire apparatus access roads)—and the Unified Development Ordinance Appendix, Emergency Vehicle Access §A-400(E)(6) (fire lanes required where parts of a structure are >150 feet from the nearest street right-of-way, or as otherwise determined by the Fire Chief), I request a site inspection and written determination on:

Whether a fire apparatus access road or fire lane is required to the rear of the Illinois Street buildings because of distance, topography, hydrant locations, or other site conditions;


Whether current barricades/vegetation in the alley constitute an obstruction to required fire access under IFC §503.4 as adopted; and


If access is required, the minimum width, surface, turning, and marking standards that apply (per IFC Appendix D as adopted) and any corrective actions needed.


Based on my own Plat of Survey (included in this email), my original frame garage structure is located more than 150 feet from the Illinois Street right-of-way. Of concern is the City’s proposed plan to vacate the alley and end its historic status as a public right-of-way, which would limit emergency access to structures throughout the E.E. Vail Addition. I am concerned the City is pursuing a strategy which conflicts with IFC §503.4 and §A-400(E)(6), while exposing itself to damages from City residents (e.g., by impairing emergency access, by increasing homeowner insurance costs).

I’m happy to meet on-site and provide perspective, photos, and measurements showing distances from the street right-of-way to the rear portions of the structures. Please let me know when a site inspection and a written determination can be completed, so I can notify my neighbors.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this public-safety matter.
