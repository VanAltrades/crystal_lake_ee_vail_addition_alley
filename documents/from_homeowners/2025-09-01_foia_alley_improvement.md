Pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (5 ILCS 140), I am requesting access to 
public records regarding alleyways in the E.E. Vail Addition to Crystal Lake. Specifically, I 
request: 

1. All ordinances, resolutions, or City Council/Board of Trustees meeting minutes relating to 
the acceptance, dedication, improvement, paving, or vacation of alleys within the 
E.E. Vail Addition (from 1900 to present). 

2. Any engineering, public works, or project records concerning grading, paving, or 
maintenance work performed on alleys in the E.E. Vail Addition. 

3. Any special assessment district records or cost-sharing agreements related to alley 
paving in the E.E. Vail Addition. 

4. Any plats, maps, or right-of-way documents showing official alley widths or 
improvements in the E.E. Vail Addition. 

I am requesting these records in order to understand what actions led to the improvement of 
certain alleys in this subdivision. 
Please provide the records in electronic format (PDF/email) if possible. If any portion of the 
request is denied, please cite the specific exemption(s) under FOIA and release all segregable 
portions of otherwise exempt material.
