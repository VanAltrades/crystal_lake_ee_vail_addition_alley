# Updates for homeowners adjacent to public alleyways in Crystal Lake, IL

## Briefing

In recent weeks, the City of Crystal Lake has claimed an alley within the E.E. Vail Addition from 1909 onward “is not public right-of-way and the City is not responsible.” The City’s statement conflicts with public record, an Illinois Professional Land Surveyor, and the lived experience of neighbors. Residents have made multiple statements objecting to the City’s premise and their omission of voting options that can benefit homeowners adjacent to alleyways. To ensure opinions and rights of homeowners are fully represented in this matter, this portal acts as a public service for residents to view historic documents, timelines, and voting measures related to public alleyways in Crystal Lake.
